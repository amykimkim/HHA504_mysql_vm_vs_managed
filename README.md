# HHA504_mysql_vm_vs_managed
Assignment 4

Note to self: VM is infrastructure as a service, while managed would be like platform as a service. Decision comes down to how much control you want and/or regulatory + team ownership is wanted + level of expertise. Paas would cost more but platforms like GCP or OCI would take care of database backups/software patches/database installs. More seamless and probably faster.
From class powerpoint slides: "building,running, and maintaining infrastructure means less time working on creating value in your app. Every layer of the stack requires attention - hardware, OS, database, and monitoring.
